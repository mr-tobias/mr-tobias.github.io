The APK file itself cannot be generated as it is a binary file and not text-based content. However, I can provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file is intentionally left blank. 

Here are the contents for the file:

/complex-html-app/complex-html-app/assets/apk/app-release.apk
<!-- This file is intentionally left blank. It should contain the APK binary data. -->
